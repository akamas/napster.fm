They probably don't hurt, but no, not necessarily; just don't be too selective about which version of a song you're after.</p> <h4>Cool. So why does Peer.fm vaguely resemble Windows 8?</h4> <p>Windows 8 introduced some interesting ideas and a nearly passable UX, but for the most part I just think the new Metro style / flat trend looks cool.</p> <p>Also, I liked the idea of reimagining <strong>[redacted]</strong> &ndash; originally a Windows 95 desktop interface &ndash; as a Windows 8-ish modern Web application.</p> <h4>Speaking of the desktop, where are my native and mobile apps? When can I run this on my toaster?</h4> <p>Stay tuned; I have some ideas about that. If you really care, just <a onclick='ui.scrollToBottom()'>shoot me an email</a> and I'll let you know as soon as I have an update.</p> <h4>Who are you?</h4> <p>My alias online is buu700, but I most often go by Ryan Lester IRL. I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon, currently taking a few years off to work at SpaceX and do other stuff. In my free time, I contribute to <a href='//w3sec.org/about'>w3sec</a>.</p> <h4>I'd like to make a small inquiry of you / spam you / ask you out on a date / give you money / take you to court / send you a comment. How can I contact you?</h4> <p>Sure, no problem; just <a onclick='ui.scrollToBottom()'>scroll to the bottom</a> for my contact information.</p> <h4>I have nothing better to do with my life; how can I contribute to Peer.fm?</h4> <p>As mentioned on the home page, everything is developed in the open on GitHub; any extra hands would be brilliant. Email me or something before sending any pull requests, but please don't hesitate to log any bug reports or feature requests in the <a href='//github.com/buu700/napster.fm/issues'>issues system</a>.</p> <h4>If I should decide to contribute, what technical specifics regarding Peer.fm should I be aware of?</h4> <p>1. To manage all of our data, I'm using the fantastic real-time "serverless" data store <a href='//firebase.com/'>Firebase</a> (YC S11). As a consequence, aside from a set of Firebase validation rules, this is pure client-side engineering; grade-A JS hackers only.</p> <p>2. Other than the Firebase SDK and the YouTube API, the major libraries and frameworks I'm using are: <a href='//code.google.com/p/closure-library'>Google Closure</a>, <a href='//angularjs.org'>AngularJS</a>, <a href='//sugarjs.com'>Sugar</a>, and <a href='//getbootstrap.com'>Bootstrap</a> (they're all brilliant).</p> <p>3. If you're used to traversing the DOM with jQuery, my Closure-based <a href='//github.com/buu700/napster.fm/blob/master/js/closurequery.js'>ClosureQuery</a> may look a bit familiar.</p> <h4>What specifically could you use help with?</h4> <p>To preface, I'm open to any proposed contribution to the project. That being said:</p> <p>1. Automated testing: Peer.fm currently has zero test coverage and I've no plans to write any myself in the near future; this could be a project for someone else to handle.</p> <p>2. Artwork: I'm currently borrowing the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akonadi'>Akonadi</a> logo for the Peer.fm favicon (no special significance; KDE's just awesome).</p> <p>3. User documentation: there is none at the moment.</p> </div> <div id='footer' class='container'> <hr/> <footer> <p> &copy; Peer.fm 2014 <br/> <a href='mailto:hacker@linux.com'>hacker@linux.com</a> <br/> +1(337) 935 0016 <br/> <a href='//plus.google.com/102924227355926902317/'>Google+</a> </p> </footer> </div> </html>
